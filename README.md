# Github Contest 2009

Archive of my development work for the **2009 GitHub Contest**, circa 2009.

## About

This project provided code to generate a solution (results.txt) to the github contest August 2009.

I participated in this contest as a learning exercise for both programming languages (ruby and then Objective-c) and technology (collaborative filtering).

See my archived write-ups [here](https://web.archive.org/web/20090908110844/http://github.com/jbrownlee/github-contest/tree/master) and [here](https://web.archive.org/web/20100903173033/http://www.neverreadpassively.com/2009/09/competition-hacking-with-ruby-and.html) for details of the methods used and finding from the data.

I think I came in 13th position.


## Code

A k-nearest neighbor recommender system was developed in Ruby, but was then abandoned because of speed issues.

A new KNN based recommender system was then developed in Objective-C.

Code was not saved.

A version of the [ruby code](https://web.archive.org/web/20100207124042/http://github.com/jbrownlee/github-contest/tree/2e8af6d982ab9c6505081bec4bae93400afadf0d/ruby) was captured on internet archive.
